/**
 * Host half of the viewer plugin: a `display_file` tool the model calls to put
 * a file on the user's screen, and the signed HTTP route that carries the bytes.
 *
 * Why a route at all, when the harness already has a durable attachment service:
 * that service is images-only, by design (`saveImage`, `readImage`,
 * `ImageAttachmentLimits.mediaTypes`). Video, audio, PDF and HTML have no
 * representation in it and no representation in model context either, so the
 * only way to get them in front of the user is to serve their bytes to the page.
 * Serving them by signed reference — rather than by a path the browser supplies
 * — is what keeps that route from being an arbitrary-file-read endpoint.
 *
 * The two paths are complementary, not redundant: an admissible raster on a
 * vision route still goes through the attachment store, because that is the only
 * way it also reaches the model.
