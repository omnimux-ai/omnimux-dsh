/**
 * Signed asset references: how a card names a file to the asset route without
 * the route ever trusting a path the browser supplied.
 *
 * The design constraint is that a card must survive a harness restart. A card
 * rebuilt from a replayed session log holds only the URL that was minted months
 * ago, so an in-process token table would leave every reopened video dead. The
 * reference is therefore self-contained — the path travels in the URL and a
 * keyed MAC travels beside it — and the route accepts a path only when the MAC
 * proves this harness minted it.
 *
 * The MAC key is the whole security boundary: without it the route would be an
 * arbitrary-file-read endpoint on a port the user's browser can reach. It is
 * generated once per harness home, stored 0600, and never leaves the Host.
