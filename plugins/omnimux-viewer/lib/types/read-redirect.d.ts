/**
 * Keeping `read` off opaque media — without turning it into a failure.
 *
 * The shipped `read` is a UTF-8 decode. Pointed at a PNG or an MP4 it does not
 * fail: it returns thousands of replacement characters, which the model then
 * tries to interpret. That is worse than an error, because the model has no
 * signal that it read nothing.
 *
 * Worse still, the shipped filesystem provider does not even get that far: it
 * samples the head of the file and throws `FS_NOT_TEXT` (`cannot read "…":
 * binary file`) on a NUL byte. So a `read` aimed at a PNG paints a RED FAILURE
 * ROW into the transcript with or without this plugin — for a file that exists,
 * is perfectly readable, and is one tool call away from being on screen.
 *
 * Neither obvious correction removes that row. A `tools/pre-execute` denial
 * materializes its own `isError`. A `tools/post-execute` decision cannot help
 * either: replacing a value is explicitly refused on a failed result, and
 * replacing content leaves `isError` set.
 *
 * The correction therefore runs in `tools/execute`, the around-dispatch
 * waterfall, and does NOT delegate — `next()` is never called, so the doomed
 * read performs no filesystem I/O at all. The authored result is what makes
 * this work: the registry feeds a wrapper's returned result through
 * `normalizeDispatchResult`, which for a success re-runs the owning tool's
 * `output.render` AND its `output.presentationMeta` over the authored value.
 * Replacing the value therefore replaces the persisted read metadata too, so
 * the shipped read card — which rebuilds itself from that metadata — renders
 * this plugin's one-line pointer as an ordinary SUCCESSFUL read.
 * @module omnimux-viewer/read-redirect
