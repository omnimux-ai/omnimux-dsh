/**
 * The asset route: bytes for one signed reference, with range support.
 *
 * Range handling is not an optimization here — it is what makes `<video>` and
 * `<audio>` seekable at all. Chrome and Safari will not expose a scrub bar for
 * a response that does not advertise `accept-ranges`, and Safari refuses to
 * start playback of a media response that answers a range request with 200.
 *
 * Bytes are streamed from the process path rather than pulled through
 * `ctx.fs.readBytes`, which materializes a whole file in memory: a two-hour
 * video is exactly the case this plugin exists for. The tradeoff is that the
 * route is only available on a backend that exposes a local path — `index.ts`
 * degrades that case to the attachment path for admissible rasters, and to an
 * unavailable card otherwise.
