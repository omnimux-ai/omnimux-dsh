 * Office and OpenDocument conversion: turn a format no browser renders into

 * The target is always PDF. A pure front-end path exists (`docx-preview` for
 * Word, `exceljs` + a grid for Excel) but does not survive this plugin's
 * constraints: the browser half is a lazy-CJS bundle whose module table answers
 * only the shell baseline, so every dependency would have to be inlined, and
 * there is no free PPTX renderer to inline in the first place. One converter
 * producing one format also means the card has exactly one document code path.
 *
 * Conversion costs seconds, so the cache is the real feature. The key covers
 * the converter version as well as the file identity, because the same bytes
 * through a newer LibreOffice are a different artifact and a stale hit would be
 * invisible.
