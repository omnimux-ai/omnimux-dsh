/**
 * Browser half of the viewer plugin.
 *
 * Registers one card into the tool-view slot for two keys: the plugin's own
 * `display_file`, and the shipped `read_image` — which upstream renders as a
 * plain text row, so an image the model already pulled into context is invisible
 * to the human sitting in front of it. `read_image` has no card registered
 * upstream, so taking that key is additive rather than a takeover.
 *
 * The card's only Host dependency is the durable attachment channel, reached
 * through `ctx.sessions`. Everything else (video, audio, PDF, HTML) arrives over
 * the Host's signed asset route as an ordinary same-origin URL.
