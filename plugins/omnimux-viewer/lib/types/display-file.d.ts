/**
 * The `display_file` tool: put a file on the user's screen.
 *
 * The difference from the shipped `read_image` is one deliberate inversion.
 * `read_image` exists to put an image into MODEL context, so it refuses outright
 * on a route that declares no image input, and it handles images only. This tool
 * exists to put a file on the SCREEN, so a text-only route is a normal outcome
 * rather than a refusal, and every medium a browser can play is in scope —
 * video, audio, PDF and HTML have no representation in model context at all and
 * would otherwise be undisplayable.
 *
 * That is why the durable facts ride `output.presentationMeta`. An image block
 * is model-facing and exists only for four raster types on one kind of route;
 * the meta is UI-facing, persists with `tool/result`, and therefore rebuilds
 * the card when the session is reopened.
 * @module omnimux-viewer/display-file
