# Typography — Three-Case Rule

The default behavior is to compose freely, without artificially carving out empty space. Empty "reserved zones" cause the model to render flat color bands or dull gradients — which always look bad. Avoid forcing them.

There are exactly three cases:

## Case 1 — User specified concrete text to include in the image

If the user wrote exact words they want on the image (`"the headline should say 'New Drop'"`, `"add 'Sale ends Friday'"`, `"with the text 'Made with love'"`), include the text DIRECTLY in the prompt as part of the composition. The model will render it as integrated typography inside the scene.

When the deliverable IS the text — an on-image headline, a logo lockup, or a flat graphic — switch the `generate_image` call to `model="gpt-image-2"`, which is tuned for legible typography. Photoreal product imagery without baked-in text stays on `model="nano-banana-2"`.

In the prompt, write something like:
```
[TYPOGRAPHY]
Integrated typography in the scene reads "New Drop" — set in {{font style: bold sans-serif / elegant serif / hand-lettered / clean modern}}, positioned {{naturally within the composition}}, color {{contrasting with background for legibility}}.
```

## Case 2 — User wants to overlay text themselves (in Figma, Canva, Photoshop)

If the user explicitly says they will add text afterward (`"I'll add the headline in Figma"`, `"leaving space for typography"`, `"need clear area for overlay"`), THEN — and only then — instruct the composition to leave a tonally uniform area:

```
[COMPOSITION FOR TEXT OVERLAY]
Leave one area of the frame visually calm and tonally uniform — natural soft gradient, atmospheric blur, or smooth surface — so the user can overlay typography in post-production. This area must still feel like part of the scene (sky, blurred background, surface), NOT a hard-edged empty rectangle.
```

The key word: **tonally uniform area within the natural scene**. Never `clean negative space` or `reserved white space` — those phrases trigger the model to draw a flat band.

## Case 3 — User said nothing about text (default)

Don't mention text or overlay zones at all. Let the model compose freely for maximum visual quality.
