# Mode: closeup-product-with-person

Tight crop showing the **product as the hero** with hands, partial face, or skin context — beauty application, holding, demonstrating, face-product interaction. The person provides context and emotion; the product carries the frame.

## Why this is its own genre

Different from `lifestyle-scene` (wide environment) and `virtual-model-tryout` (full body fashion). This mode is specifically:
- Closeup framing — tight crop on product + adjacent body part
- Product is always the visual anchor
- Person is partial — never the focal subject, always context
- High-end DTC beauty / skincare / fragrance / supplement / wellness aesthetic

## Closeup Presets

| Preset | Use for | Visual signature |
|---|---|---|
| `serum-application` | Skincare, beauty oils, treatments | Hand applying product to face, dropper or spatula visible, glowing skin texture |
| `lipstick-on-lips` | Lip products, lip care, gloss | Tight closeup on lips, product near or applied, sharp catchlight |
| `hand-holding-vertical` | Beauty bottles, fragrance, skincare | Hand cradling product vertically, wrist visible, soft light on glass |
| `pour-into-palm` | Cream, lotion, oil, supplement | Liquid or product poured into open palm, rich texture visible |
| `eye-makeup-closeup` | Mascara, shadow, liner | Eye area in tight crop, product nearby or applied, lash detail |
| `texture-on-skin` | Cream, balm, scrub, foundation | Product swatched or applied on hand/cheek, ingredient texture visible |
| `dropper-mid-air` | Serums, oils with droppers | Dropper hovering near skin with single drop suspended, clinical premium feel |
| `hands-cradling-jar` | Body products, candles, jars | Two hands cradling open jar, fingers in product, indulgent ritual |
| `face-touch-product` | Skincare results, glowing skin | Hand resting on cheek, product nearby, product association with skin result |
| `mouth-bite-or-sip` | Food, beverage, supplements | Lips/teeth interacting with product (sip, bite, taste), sensory focus |

## Prompt Template

```
[FRAMING]
Tight closeup composition. Product is the hero of the frame, occupying {{rough percentage 40-60%}} of visible area. {{Specific crop — face from nose to chin / hands cradling product / palm with poured product / eye area with product nearby}}.

[PRODUCT]
{{Exact product description from reference or memory}}, {{material/finish details}}, {{label/branding visible if applicable}}, sharp focus on product.

[PERSON CONTEXT]
{{Specific body part visible — hands with natural skin texture / lips with realistic detail / cheek with glowing skin / eye area with lash detail}}. Person is partial context, not the focal subject. {{Skin tone aligned with brand audience or specified}}.

[INTERACTION]
{{Specific action — applying, holding, pouring, touching, demonstrating}}. Natural, unstaged, ritualistic feel.

[LIGHTING]
{{Specific lighting setup — see Lighting Setups below}}. {{Direction, quality, color temp}}. Sharp catchlight on product surface. Realistic skin highlight without plasticity.

[LENS & CAMERA]
Shot on {{100mm macro / 85mm portrait}}, aperture {{f/2.8 to f/4}}, shallow DoF, sharp focus on product surface, gentle bokeh on skin background.

[SKIN & DETAIL]
Realistic skin texture with natural pores and micro-imperfections, no smoothing, no plasticity. Hands and fingers anatomically correct. Hair detail crisp if visible.

[COLOR PALETTE]
{{2-3 dominant tones aligned with brand memory}}. Warm or cool dominance per brand. Product colors faithful to reference.

[STYLE REFERENCE]
{{Descriptors extracted from 2-3 photographer rows in the photographer-references.md beauty/closeup section — never the names}}. Editorial beauty photography, premium DTC standard.

[PRODUCT FIDELITY DIRECTIVE]
Product remains identical to reference — same color, material, design, branding. Person is supporting context. Product is the visual anchor.

[QUALITY MARKERS]
Magazine-cover quality, hyper-detailed, photorealistic, premium beauty editorial standard, no AI artifacts.

[AVOID]
{{universal + anti-uncanny + anti-text-warp}}
no full face dominating the frame, no person taking focus from product,
no plastic skin, no airbrush look, no warped fingers,
no over-staged feeling, no clinical sterile feel where warmth needed.
```

(Pass aspect ratio via the `aspect_ratio` parameter and `resolution="2K"` on the `generate_image` call — they are not part of the prompt body.)

## Aspect Ratio

| Use case | Ratio |
|---|---|
| Instagram feed | `4:5` (default) |
| E-commerce closeup | `1:1` |

| Story / TikTok | `9:16` |
| Editorial wide | `3:2` or `16:9` |

Default `4:5`.

## Composition rules

- **Product first, person second** — if the person dominates the frame, recompose
- **Product occupies 40–60% of visible area** — never less than 30%, never more than 70%
- **Rule of thirds for product placement** — never dead-center unless dramatic intent
- **Hands shown? Specify finger position** — relaxed natural grip, not stiff
- **Face partial only** — never full face, only nose-to-chin, eye area, lips, or cheek
- **Background blur supports product** — gentle bokeh, not muddy, not distracting
- **Skin texture realistic** — pores, fine hairs, natural imperfection — never airbrushed

## Generation invocation

Product reference must be preserved — pass its asset ID via `image_urls`:

```
generate_image(
  prompt="<assembled prompt>",
  output_asset_id="closeup:main",
  aspect_ratio="4:5",
  resolution="2K",
  model="nano-banana-2",
  image_urls=["product:reference"]
)
```

For batch (different presets, same product — reuse the same product asset ID across all variants, each with its own `output_asset_id`):

```
generate_image(prompt="<serum-application prompt>", output_asset_id="closeup:serum", aspect_ratio="4:5", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["product:reference"])
generate_image(prompt="<dropper-mid-air prompt>", output_asset_id="closeup:dropper", aspect_ratio="4:5", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["product:reference"])
generate_image(prompt="<hand-holding prompt>", output_asset_id="closeup:hand", aspect_ratio="4:5", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["product:reference"])
```

(If the product reference is an external URL, register it first with `register_asset(url="https://...", asset_id="product:reference")`.)
