# Mode: restyle

Take an existing image and transform its aesthetic, mood, or seasonal context while preserving the subject, composition, and core identity. Combines two axes — aesthetic mood and seasonal/holiday context — into one mode.

## Two axes

This mode operates on TWO axes that can be used independently or together:

**Axis 1 — Aesthetic mood**: clean girl, cottagecore, Y2K, minimal, dark academia, quiet luxury, scandinavian, coastal grandmother, maximalist, brutalist, art-deco, retro-90s, futurist, japandi, bohemian, mid-century modern, gothic-romance, pastel-dream

**Axis 2 — Seasonal / holiday context**: Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Back to School, Pride, New Year's, Summer, Spring, Fall, Winter, Lunar New Year, 4th of July

Either axis alone, or both combined ("Christmas version in cottagecore style").

## Prompt Template

```
[SOURCE]
Restyle the referenced image. PRESERVE: {{subject identity, composition, framing, focal anchor, product details}}.

[TRANSFORMATION]
TRANSFORM into {{aesthetic preset}} {{+ seasonal preset if applicable}} aesthetic.

[AESTHETIC SHIFT]
{{Specific visual cues from chosen aesthetic preset}}. {{Surface and texture changes}}. {{Mood shift}}.

[SEASONAL SHIFT]
{{If seasonal axis used: specific seasonal cues to introduce}}. {{Palette shift toward seasonal tones}}.

[PALETTE]
Shift dominant palette to {{exact palette from preset}}. Keep product's intrinsic colors recognizable.

[LIGHTING]
{{New lighting matching the aesthetic — direction, quality, color temp}}. Different from the source image's lighting if needed.

[TEXTURE & SURFACE]
{{Specific surface treatments from the aesthetic preset}}.

[STYLE REFERENCE]
{{Descriptors extracted from 2-3 photographer rows matched to the aesthetic in photographer-references.md — never the names}}.

[PRESERVATION DIRECTIVE]
The subject and composition must remain recognizable as the same image — only the aesthetic and atmosphere change.

[QUALITY MARKERS]
Hyper-realistic, magazine-quality, photorealistic, faithful to source subject.

[AVOID]
{{universal + anti-aesthetic-mixing}}
no change to subject identity, no change to composition, no change to product appearance.
```

(Pass aspect ratio via the `aspect_ratio` parameter and `resolution="2K"` on the `generate_image` call — they are not part of the prompt body.)

## Generation invocation

The source image must be passed as a reference via `image_urls`. Two paths depending on where the source lives:

**Source is a previous generation from earlier in this session** — reference its `output_asset_id` directly:

```
generate_image(
  prompt="<assembled restyle prompt>",
  output_asset_id="restyle:main",
  aspect_ratio="<same as source>",
  resolution="2K",
  model="nano-banana-2",
  image_urls=["product:main"]
)
```

**Source is a user upload / external URL** — discover it with `list_assets` / `get_asset`, or register an external URL first, then pass the asset ID:

```
register_asset(url="https://...", asset_id="restyle:source")

generate_image(
  prompt="<assembled restyle prompt>",
  output_asset_id="restyle:main",
  aspect_ratio="<same as source>",
  resolution="2K",
  model="nano-banana-2",
  image_urls=["restyle:source"]
)
```

For multiple variant restyles (reuse the same source reference across variants, each with its own `output_asset_id`):

```
generate_image(prompt="<christmas-quiet-luxury>", output_asset_id="restyle:xmas", aspect_ratio="<same as source>", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["restyle:source"])
generate_image(prompt="<valentines-clean-girl>", output_asset_id="restyle:val", aspect_ratio="<same as source>", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["restyle:source"])
generate_image(prompt="<halloween-dark-academia>", output_asset_id="restyle:hween", aspect_ratio="<same as source>", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["restyle:source"])
```

## Quality gates

- [ ] Subject preserved from source
- [ ] Composition preserved from source
- [ ] Aesthetic shift is strong and committed (not half-applied)
- [ ] Palette matches the preset
- [ ] Seasonal cues read clearly (if used)
- [ ] No kitsch — restyle feels editorial, not gimmicky
- [ ] Aspect ratio matches source unless user requested change
- [ ] `generate_image` call set `resolution="2K"`
