# Mode: virtual-model-tryout

Fashion-grade product imagery where a product is worn or used by an AI-rendered model. Replaces the cost of a fashion shoot for DTC brands selling clothing, accessories, jewelry, eyewear, watches, bags, hats, footwear.

## What this mode does (and does NOT do)

**Does**: Renders a fresh AI model wearing or using the product in a fashion-shoot context, controlled by detailed prompt description (model demographics, pose, expression, environment).

**Does NOT**: Train an identity. Does not remember a model between generations. Every generation describes the model from scratch through the prompt.

This means: each batch of images can show the same "type" of model (e.g. "woman in late twenties, dark hair, athletic build") but they will not be the literal same person.

## Prompt Template

```
[PRODUCT]
{{Exact product description from reference or memory}}, worn / displayed on the model's {{specific body area}}.

[MODEL]
{{Detailed model archetype: gender presentation, approximate age range, ethnicity if specified, hair color/style, build, height implied, skin tone}}. Natural realistic features, anatomically correct, professional model proportions.

[POSE]
{{Specific pose: standing three-quarter, walking confident, leaning, sitting, action pose, candid moment}}. {{Hand positions}}, {{eye direction}}, {{expression}}.

[FRAMING]
{{Full body / three-quarter / waist-up / closeup on product area}}, {{rule of thirds placement}}.

[ENVIRONMENT]
{{Specific backdrop or location per preset}}.

[WARDROBE / STYLING]
{{What else the model is wearing besides the product — neutral coordinated wardrobe / fashion-forward layered / minimal}}, complementing the featured product without competing.

[LIGHTING]
{{Specific lighting setup — see Lighting Setups below}}. {{Direction, quality, color temp}}. {{Skin highlight behavior}}.

[LENS & CAMERA]
Shot on {{50mm natural / 85mm portrait / 35mm environmental}}, aperture {{f/2.8 to f/5.6}}, sharp focus on {{product area}}, depth of field {{shallow / medium}}.

[SKIN & DETAIL]
Realistic skin texture with natural pores, no smoothing, no plasticity. Hair has individual strand detail. Hands and fingers anatomically correct.

[STYLE REFERENCE]
{{Descriptors extracted from 2-3 fashion photographer rows in photographer-references.md — never the names}}. Editorial fashion photography.

[PRODUCT FIDELITY DIRECTIVE]
The product must remain identical to the reference — same color, material, design details, proportions, branding placement. The model wears it without altering it.

[QUALITY MARKERS]
Magazine-cover quality, hyper-realistic, professional fashion photography standard.

[AVOID]
{{universal + anti-uncanny + anti-text-warp}}
no clothing items that fight the featured product, no oversexualized poses,
no warped product geometry, no altered product color.

(Pass aspect ratio via the `aspect_ratio` parameter and `resolution="2K"` on the `generate_image` call — they are not part of the prompt body.)

## Body and pose anatomy rules

Critical for avoiding AI uncanny output:

- **Hands**: specify finger position explicitly — "relaxed fingers loosely curled at side", "hand on hip with thumb out", "hand holding strap with natural grip"
- **Feet**: specify shoe and ground contact — "feet planted shoulder-width, weight on back leg"
- **Face**: specify eye direction and expression — eyes in the wrong direction is the most common tell
- **Posture**: specify spine curve and shoulder placement — natural posture not stiff
- **Proportions**: prompt for "natural human proportions, anatomically correct"

## Product fidelity rules

The product is the hero. The model is the canvas:

- Pass the product reference image whenever possible
- Explicitly state in prompt: "product remains identical to reference — preserve color, texture, branding, design details"
- For closeups, framing should clearly show the product without being obscured
- For wide shots, product still needs to be visible and identifiable

## Aspect Ratio

| Use case | Ratio |
|---|---|
| E-commerce on-model main | `4:5` |
| Lookbook editorial | `3:4` or `2:3` |
| Instagram feed | `4:5` |
| Pinterest | `2:3` |
| Story / TikTok | `9:16` |
| Wide editorial | `16:9` |

Default `4:5`.

## Generation invocation

Product reference must be preserved — pass its asset ID via `image_urls`:

```
generate_image(
  prompt="<assembled prompt>",
  output_asset_id="tryout:main",
  aspect_ratio="4:5",
  resolution="2K",
  model="nano-banana-2",
  image_urls=["product:reference"]
)
```

For batch (same product, different model archetypes or environments — reuse the same product asset ID across all variants, each with its own `output_asset_id`):

```
generate_image(prompt="<archetype A in studio>", output_asset_id="tryout:studio", aspect_ratio="4:5", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["product:reference"])
generate_image(prompt="<archetype B outdoor>", output_asset_id="tryout:outdoor", aspect_ratio="4:5", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["product:reference"])
generate_image(prompt="<archetype C street style>", output_asset_id="tryout:street", aspect_ratio="4:5", resolution="2K", model="nano-banana-2", image_urls=["product:reference"])
```

(If the product reference is an external URL, register it first with `register_asset(url="https://...", asset_id="product:reference")`.)
