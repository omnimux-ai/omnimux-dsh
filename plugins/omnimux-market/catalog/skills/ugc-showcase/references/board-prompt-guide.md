# UGC Product Board Prompt Guide (4-Slot 21:9 — Product-Hero)

Use this when composing the `prompt` for `generate_image` to produce a 21:9 four-slot UGC product-focused storyboard sheet for ONE Seedance video clip.

The output of this composition is a single prose prompt string (no JSON wrapper, no markdown fences). The orchestrator skill passes that string as `generate_image(prompt=...)` with `aspect_ratio="21:9"`, `resolution="1K"`, `model="gpt-image-2.5-sunburst"`, and `image_urls` in the order specified below — so `@Image1`, `@Image2`, ... in your prompt text bind directly to those resolved URLs.

CORE PRINCIPLE: The sheet is a sequential UGC product-focused storyboard for ONE 15-second-or-shorter video clip — four frames showing four narrative moments inside that single clip. **The PRODUCT is the hero of every slot.** Person, when present in the frame, is auxiliary — cropped, hands-only, partial body, or first-person POV — and never the focal subject. Person's identity is not preserved (no recurring character reference). NOT a presentation deck. No headers, no metadata blocks, no pop-text captions, no badges, no numbers, no brand-matched design system, no typography of any kind. Just four equal-size 9:16 slots in one row, each containing a photorealistic UGC iPhone-style still that advances a coherent product-demo story. Slots are separated by thin white gutters. **All four slots are always active — there are no placeholders.** **The four slots follow a fixed product-demo arc: PRODUCT-INTRO → PRODUCT-DEMO-A → PRODUCT-DEMO-B → PRODUCT-RESULT** (Board 1 always carries this arc; Boards 2..N continue with additional demo angles).

The product follows strict Angle Lock, Realistic Scale, and Placement Logic rules.

Story matters. Setting matters. Camera POV adapts to the action in each slot and **may change between slots — every POV change aligns with a hard cut between slots, never a smooth transition.** Hand count is enforced when an auxiliary person appears in frame.

## CRITICAL LAYOUT GUARD (gpt-image-2.5-sunburst — include verbatim in every composed prompt)

This guard fixes two known failure modes specific to gpt-image-2.5-sunburst (the model the skill uses for board generation):

1. **gpt-image-2.5-sunburst misreads "four 9:16 slots in a 21:9 sheet" as "four wide horizontal bands stacked top-to-bottom"** — producing a vertical stack of full-width strips instead of four side-by-side columns.
2. **gpt-image-2.5-sunburst has a strong "label the panels" prior** that auto-adds forbidden "SLOT 1 / SLOT 2 / SLOT 3 / SLOT 4" typography (and sometimes numbers, captions, or "Panel X" tags) directly onto the rendered output, overriding any vague "no text" instruction.

To counter both, the composed prompt MUST include the following block verbatim, placed near the top of the prompt (right after the `@ImageN` reference lines and before the per-slot descriptions). Do NOT summarize, paraphrase, or shorten it — the explicit redundancy is load-bearing:

```
CRITICAL LAYOUT (read first, applies to the entire output): The output is a LANDSCAPE WIDE strip in 21:9 aspect ratio — roughly 2.33 TIMES WIDER than it is TALL. Inside this wide strip, there are exactly FOUR identical TALL NARROW vertical panels (each 9:16 portrait orientation — TALLER than WIDE, the proportions of a single phone screen), arranged from LEFT to RIGHT in a single horizontal row. The four panels divide the wide strip horizontally into FOUR EQUAL COLUMNS, separated by thin white vertical gutters. The aspect of each individual panel is 9 wide by 16 tall — a tall narrow rectangle. The aspect of the full sheet is 21 wide by 9 tall — a wide short strip.

DO NOT lay out the panels as four wide horizontal bands stacked top-to-bottom — that is the wrong layout. The panels are columns side-by-side, not rows stacked. The dividers between panels are VERTICAL white gutters, never horizontal lines.

DO NOT add any text, labels, numbers, captions, panel identifiers, headers, footers, watermarks, or typography of any kind anywhere on the output. Specifically forbidden: "SLOT 1", "SLOT 2", "SLOT 3", "SLOT 4", "Panel 1/2/3/4", "#1 #2 #3 #4", "1 of 4", "Frame 1", or any other panel-naming text. There is no on-image typography of any kind on this storyboard sheet. The only text that may appear is the product's own real label printed on the physical product itself when the product is in frame.
```

This block is the single most important rendering directive for gpt-image-2.5-sunburst. Include it verbatim near the top of every composed prompt for every board (K=1 and K>1).

---

## Inputs (provided in the skill dispatch)

1. **Product image(s)** — REQUIRED. The product is the hero of every slot. Used for product reference + Angle Lock.
2. **Previous-board image** — OPTIONAL. Provided when this board is K>1 in a multi-board sequence. Used to preserve product / location / lighting / overall aesthetic across boards.
3. **Product description** — OPTIONAL. Source of truth for product name, category, mechanics, claims, demo contexts.
4. **Text request** — what the user wants the demo story to be.
5. **Arc role** — passed externally. For Board 1: `BOARD_1_PRODUCT_DEMO` (slots PRODUCT-INTRO → PRODUCT-DEMO-A → PRODUCT-DEMO-B → PRODUCT-RESULT). For Boards 2..N: `BOARD_K_PRODUCT_DEMO` (additional product-demo angles, conditioned on previous board's final slot).
6. **`voice_gender`** — passed externally. One of: `female`, `male`, `random`. Drives the gender of any auxiliary person rendered in frame (when present). `random` → pick female or male at random for this board, but stay consistent within a single board.
7. **Clip duration** — 4 to 15 seconds. The single Seedance clip this board produces.
8. **Board index K and total boards N** — context for chaining ("Board 2 of 3").

---

## Image Reference Order

Standard order (the orchestrator's `image_urls` array must match this — `@Image1` is the first element, `@Image2` the second, etc.):

| References provided | Order |
|---|---|
| Product + previous board (K>1) | `@Image1` = product, `@Image2` = previous board |
| Product only (K=1) | `@Image1` = product |

The prompt MUST start with explicit `@ImageN` references in this order. **No character reference image** is passed — the auxiliary person, when present, is rendered inline.

---

## Input Tiers

| Tier | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| Auto | 1-5 words, no scenario, only product name, "make video", or empty | Full autopilot: build a default 4-slot product-demo arc per the canonical roles. |
| Guided | 1-3 sentences with general idea, tone, mood, or rough flow | Preserve user's tone/emphasis/mood. Build slot structure yourself. |
| Director | 4+ sentences with specific scenario, demo sequence, shot list, location sequence | Map user's beats 1:1 onto the 4 slots in their order. Adapt only physically unsafe interactions. |

---

## User Override Rule

If the user specifies any concrete detail — setting, location, demo action, mood, time of day, props, slot order, story beats — that detail takes priority over every default below.

---

## Step 1 — Product Understanding

### Mode A: Product image(s) + product description provided
Use the description directly. Extract: product name, brand, category, key features, intended use, container material, applicator type, visible design details, safe-to-mention claims, plausible demo contexts.

### Mode B: Product image(s), no description
Visually analyze:
1. Product category
2. Container material — glass, hard plastic, soft tube, metal, cardboard, fabric, food packaging, tech, appliance, unknown
3. Applicator type — removable cap, pump, dropper/pipette, wand, spray nozzle, twist-up, flip top, compact hinge, trigger, button, none
4. Usage mechanic
5. Key visual details — color, label text, logo, shape, distinctive features
6. Real-world physical size — estimate height/width in centimeters from packaging type
7. Plausible demo contexts — where the product is used, on what surface, against what target
8. Forbidden actions — anything that breaks physics, deforms rigid packaging, or invents unseen sides

A product is REQUIRED for this flow. No-product variants are not valid — route to a different flow.

---

## Step 2 — Person Rendering Rules

The person, when present in the frame, is auxiliary. Rules:

- **No character reference image is provided.** Person is rendered directly inside the board (no pre-generated character).
- **Person is NEVER the focal subject.** No full-body portraits, no head-and-shoulders centered selfies of the person.
- **Person appears only as supporting cast for the product:**
  - Cropped framing (chest-down / waist-down / hands-only / partial body at edge)
  - First-person POV (the camera IS the person; only their hand or forearm at frame edge holding/using the product)
  - Wide context (person far away in environment using the product, product still readable as the focal element)
  - Absent entirely (pure product shot, no person at all)
- **Identity is not preserved.** Different boards or slots may show different incidental people. Do not enforce "same face across slots" — instead enforce "consistent gender across slots within one board, matching `voice_gender`".
- **Gender match.** When an auxiliary person is rendered, their gender matches the `voice_gender` parameter (`female` / `male` / `random`-then-locked-for-the-board).
- **No on-camera dialogue.** Person never appears with mouth open speaking, never gestures toward the lens "explaining" with open mouth. The audio is voice-over off-screen — the person on camera is silent.
- Never describe the person's age, ethnicity, attractiveness, makeup, or facial features in detail. Brief functional descriptors only ("adult woman's hand", "man's silhouette in background").

In every prompt, include:

`The person, when present in any slot, is auxiliary — cropped, hands-only, partial body, or first-person POV — never the focal subject. Person's mouth is closed; no on-camera dialogue. Auxiliary person's gender matches the voice_gender parameter for this board.`

---

## Step 3 — Setting and Lighting Logic

Default: setting derives from the product's category and natural use context. Reference in the prompt:

`Setting in all four slots is derived from the product's natural use context — the place(s) where this product is normally used. Lighting in all four slots is consistent — same time of day, same light direction across slots within the same location.`

When K > 1 and a previous-board reference is provided: the setting and lighting MUST match the previous board exactly (same room, same light direction, same time of day) UNLESS the story explicitly transitions to a new use context.

For product-driven setting matching:
- Cosmetics / makeup / fragrance → bathroom or bedroom vanity
- Skincare / haircare / body care → bathroom (vanity, shower, sink)
- Food / beverages / kitchen products → kitchen (counter, island, stovetop, dining table)
- Protein / supplements / sports nutrition → kitchen (post-workout) or home gym
- Clothing / accessories / jewelry → bedroom, dressing room, or styled flat-lay surface
- Fitness gear / equipment → home gym, yoga corner, living room mat area
- Cars / vehicles → driveway, sunlit street, garage
- Outdoor gear / sunglasses / sunscreen → cafe terrace, park, sunlit street
- Tech / electronics → home desk, living room, studio nook
- Home / decor / candles → living room or bedroom
- Cleaning appliances (vacuum, mop, steamer) → carpeted living room, kitchen, hallway, ceiling/wall corner — wherever the appliance is used
- Pet products → relevant pet zone (bowl on kitchen floor, leash by entry, bed in living room)
- Tools / hardware → workshop, garage, project surface

### Native Use Accessories per category (mandatory)

A product alone in a frame reads as a stock photo, not as UGC. To ground the product as "in real use", every board MUST include 2-3 category-appropriate accessories visible across the 4 slots (not necessarily all in one slot — distributed). These accessories signal that the product belongs in this environment and is actually used — not just photographed for an ad.

| Category | Native use accessories (include 2-3 across the 4 slots) |
|---|---|
| Gaming peripherals (mouse, keyboard, headphones, controller) | mousepad / desk-mat surface, partial keyboard at frame edge, monitor with on-screen content (gameplay / desktop / app visible), notebook or coffee mug nearby, soft ambient room lighting (NOT dramatic RGB-only — see Step 11 iPhone aesthetic) |
| Cosmetics / makeup | vanity tabletop with brushes, partial mirror, jewelry tray, cotton pads, neighbouring open bottles |
| Skincare / haircare / body care | vanity counter, neighbouring product bottles, towel partial, plant, water glass, sink edge partial |
| Perfume / fragrance | dressing-room vanity, perfume tray with another bottle nearby, dried flowers / glass dish, jewelry tray partial |
| Food / beverages / kitchen products | counter with ingredients (fruit / herbs / glass), serving plate or glass, cutting board partial, kitchen-utensil partial |
| Protein / supplements / sports nutrition | shaker bottle, sports towel, water bottle, gym mat partial OR kitchen counter context |
| Clothing / accessories / jewelry | closet rack partial, hanger, mirror partial, lifestyle pieces (handbag / shoes / belt) on flat surface |
| Fitness gear / equipment | yoga mat, dumbbells partial, water bottle, gym towel, training shoes at edge |
| Cars / vehicles | road / driveway / garage floor visible, building or street context, second car partial in background |
| Outdoor gear / sunglasses / sunscreen | beach towel, sand or grass, sunhat, outdoor cafe table, drink |
| Tech / electronics (non-peripheral) | desk with notebook / pen, plant, ambient room context, second device partial |
| Home / decor / candles | sofa partial, throw blanket, plant, book stack, side table |
| Cleaning appliances (vacuum / mop / steamer) | floor texture (carpet / hardwood / tile) clearly visible, visible dust / dirt / cobwebs in the DEMO-A area BEFORE the pass, clean stripe / cleared surface AFTER the pass in DEMO-B or RESULT, dustpan / bucket / cleaning cloth nearby |
| Pet products | pet bowl, pet bed, leash hook, pet toy, the pet itself partial in frame (back of head / paws / tail) |
| Tools / hardware | workbench surface, screws / nails on surface, lumber / project material, safety glasses, tape measure |

Distribution rule: the accessories don't all have to appear in every slot — distribute them across the 4 slots so the product's world is built up cumulatively. Slot 1 (PRODUCT-INTRO) typically shows 2-3 accessories together as the establishing context. Slots 2 and 3 (DEMO-A / DEMO-B) usually focus tighter on the product + the demo target (one or two accessories at the edge). Slot 4 (PRODUCT-RESULT) returns to a wider context with the result visible.

Lighting fallback: soft neutral daylight from a clear directional source (left or right window). Never golden hour or warm sunset unless user explicitly asks. Never harsh studio strobes.

---

## Step 4 — Canonical Product Arc Across the 4 Slots

Every product-flow board carries a canonical 4-slot product-demo arc. **Board 1** always follows this sequence:

| Slot | Role | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PRODUCT-INTRO | Product in its native context — on a surface / in environment / first establishing frame. Clean composition, product readable. Person may be entirely absent OR only suggested by a hand / POV at frame edge. The product is being introduced — not yet in active use. |
| 2 | PRODUCT-DEMO-A | Product in active use — first demonstration angle. LLM picks based on product category (vacuum on carpet; perfume mist on wrist; blender pouring smoothie; serum drop on fingertip; cordless drill driving a screw). Person, when in frame, is auxiliary — cropped framing, hands-only, partial body, or first-person POV. The product is doing what it does. |
| 3 | PRODUCT-DEMO-B | Product in active use — SECOND demonstration angle, distinctly different from Slot 2. Variation may be: different action (vacuum on carpet vs ceiling), different scale (wide functional shot vs tight macro of mechanism), different context (kitchen vs hallway), different target (perfume on wrist vs neck). The variation must be visually unmistakable from Slot 2. |
| 4 | PRODUCT-RESULT | Product in result / outcome state. **Slot 4 MUST be visually distinct from Slot 1** — never the same composition, angle, scale, or surface placement. Two valid forms: (a) the OUTCOME of the demo with the result clearly visible (cleaned floor visible behind / styled hair visible / finished pour in a glass / cleared dust on previously dirty surface) — the visible result IS the differentiator from Slot 1, OR (b) a hero shot of the product in a meaningfully different framing from Slot 1 — different angle (overhead vs side), different scale (macro vs medium), different surface, OR with the auxiliary person in a clearly different role/pose than Slot 1. Person may be present (cropped, satisfied gesture toward the result) or absent. |

For multi-board (K > 1) videos, Board 1 carries the canonical arc above. Boards 2..N continue with **4 additional product-demo beats** — different demo angles, different contexts, different scales — conditioned on the previous board's final slot. Boards 2..N slot-arc specifics are not strictly fixed — the LLM picks 4 distinct demo beats per board that don't repeat what previous boards covered.

### First slot IS the product introduction

Unlike unboxing or talking-head UGC, **Slot 1 of a product-flow board MUST always show the product in its native context** — clean introduction, not yet in active use. This is a hard rule for Board 1: the product story begins by establishing what the product IS and where it lives.

The active demonstration lands in Slot 2 (PRODUCT-DEMO-A) and Slot 3 (PRODUCT-DEMO-B). Never default Slot 1 to "product mid-action" — that's a Slot 2 / 3 beat.

---

## Step 4.5 — Slot Action Diversity (mandatory)

The 4 slots MUST show four DIFFERENT product states / demo angles, not four variations of the same shot. Same product-pose / same hand-product configuration in all four slots = the storyboard reads as one frozen moment, not a story.

### Default action per slot (Board 1 canonical product arc)

| Slot | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 (PRODUCT-INTRO) | Product placed in its native context — sitting on a surface, in its environment. No active use. Clean establishing frame. Person may be absent or only a hand at frame edge "presenting" the product gently. |
| 2 (PRODUCT-DEMO-A) | Product in active demonstration — first angle. The product is performing its function. Auxiliary person (when present) is cropped / hands-only / partial. Camera may be tripod (locked-off) or first-person POV. |
| 3 (PRODUCT-DEMO-B) | Product in active demonstration — DIFFERENT angle from Slot 2. Different action OR different scale (wide vs macro) OR different context (room A vs room B) OR different target. |
| 4 (PRODUCT-RESULT) | Product result state — outcome of the demo OR a final hero shot **visually distinct from Slot 1** (different angle / different scale / different surface, OR with the demo's outcome clearly visible). Settled, conclusive frame. Never reuse Slot 1's composition. Auxiliary person, when present, is in a cropped "satisfied" supporting pose (hands gesturing toward result, partial body in background). |

For Boards 2..N (multi-board >15s): the canonical arc above applies to Board 1 only. Boards 2..N continue with 4 different product-demo angles each, conditioned on the previous board's final slot. The 4 slots within each Board 2..N still carry the slot-action-diversity rule (4 distinct shots, not 4 variations of one).

### Default POV cadence (Board 1)

`TRIPOD-WIDE → TRIPOD-MEDIUM → MACRO-OR-FIRST-PERSON-POV → TRIPOD-WIDE`

| Slot | POV | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 PRODUCT-INTRO | TRIPOD-WIDE | Establishing shot — product in context, locked-off, room readable |
| 2 PRODUCT-DEMO-A | TRIPOD-MEDIUM | Product in use, locked-off, demo action clearly visible |
| 3 PRODUCT-DEMO-B | MACRO or FIRST-PERSON-POV | Tight angle on product mechanism / second demo target — different perceptual scale |
| 4 PRODUCT-RESULT | TRIPOD-WIDE or TRIPOD-MEDIUM | Pulled back to show the result + product settled in context |

If user-Director input or product category requires a different cadence (e.g., a tiny cosmetic product → all 4 slots may be MACRO-leaning; a large appliance → TRIPOD-WIDE dominates), apply the override but never alternate POV more than necessary. Variation is good; chaos is not.

### Camera Distance Variation (mandatory)

Each of the 4 slots MUST use a DIFFERENT camera distance/framing. Default cadence for Board 1:

| Slot | Distance |
|---|---|
| 1 PRODUCT-INTRO | MEDIUM-WIDE — product + room context visible, clean composition |
| 2 PRODUCT-DEMO-A | MEDIUM — product + demo target both clearly visible (hand + product + body part / surface) |
| 3 PRODUCT-DEMO-B | MACRO or TIGHT CLOSE-UP — product mechanism / texture / detail fills the frame |
| 4 PRODUCT-RESULT | MEDIUM-WIDE or THREE-QUARTER — pulled back to show result + product in final settled context |

The slot description MUST explicitly state the framing distance — `TIGHT CLOSE-UP`, `MEDIUM CLOSE-UP`, `MEDIUM`, `MEDIUM-WIDE`, `MACRO`, `THREE-QUARTER`, `WAIST-UP`, `FULL-BODY WIDE`, `PRODUCT-EXTENDED`, `PRODUCT-WIDE` — so the image model receives an unambiguous framing signal. Distance change between slots aligns with the hard cut between them.

### Distance band rule (mandatory)

The 4 slot framings MUST span at least **one TIGHT band** (TIGHT CLOSE-UP / MACRO), at least **one MID band** (MEDIUM CLOSE-UP / MEDIUM), and at least **one WIDE band** (MEDIUM-WIDE / THREE-QUARTER / FULL-BODY WIDE / PRODUCT-WIDE). If all 4 slots fall within the same band — e.g., all macros, all medium close-ups — REWRITE.

### Per-category DEMO-A vs DEMO-B pairings (concrete examples)

When choosing demo angles for Slot 2 (PRODUCT-DEMO-A) and Slot 3 (PRODUCT-DEMO-B), use the pairings below as concrete templates rather than defaulting to "same action, different scale". The variation between Slot 2 and Slot 3 must be visually unmistakable — different action, different target surface, or different demo context.

| Category | Slot 2 (DEMO-A) | Slot 3 (DEMO-B) — distinctly different |
|---|---|---|
| Gaming mouse | Hand on the mouse, mouse glides across the pad while monitor shows in-game movement | Macro on the scroll-wheel rolling under the index finger, OR thumb pressing a side-button — different mechanism action, not just closer scale |
| Mechanical keyboard | Both hands typing, multiple keys depressed in sequence | Macro on a single keycap depressing under one finger with tactile snap |
| Headphones (over-ear) | Worn on head, hand adjusts the headband | Macro on the ear-cup cushion compressing as it settles |
| Game controller | Both hands grip, thumbs on analog sticks during gameplay | Macro on a shoulder trigger being squeezed by the index finger |
| Smartphone | One hand cradles the phone, other hand swiping the screen | Macro of finger tapping a specific UI element (button / icon / app) |
| Vacuum cleaner | Wide shot of the vacuum gliding across living-room carpet | Different surface — head pressed against ceiling / wall corner via extension wand, OR macro on the suction nozzle picking up a cobweb / dust particle |
| Drill | Drill in standard pose driving a screw into wood (medium framing) | Macro on the drill bit rotating with chips emerging from the wood |
| Blender | Counter shot, button pressed, contents spinning visible through the jug | Pour shot — contents leaving the jug into a glass / bowl (different action) |
| Perfume / cologne | Mist arcing from the nozzle onto the wrist (medium-tight) | Macro on droplets settling on skin texture, the bottle resting nearby (post-spray) |
| Serum dropper | Dropper held up, drops falling onto a fingertip | Macro of the serum being pressed into the cheek with two fingertips (different target) |
| Cream jar | Lid twisted off, fingertip scoops cream from the jar | Macro of fingertip pressing cream into the back of the hand or face |
| Lipstick | Cap pulled off, base twisted up to reveal the bullet | Macro of the lipstick gliding across the lips (different target) |
| Spray bottle / mist | Trigger pressed, mist dispersing toward face / hair | Macro of mist droplets settling on skin / hair (post-spray) |
| Food / drink | Pour from container into a glass / bowl | Hand brings glass / utensil to mouth for a sip / bite (different action and target) |
| Clothing / accessories | Garment held up by both hands, displayed front | Worn on body (cropped: torso, hands smoothing the fabric) — different state |
| Fitness gear (dumbbell, kettlebell) | Lift / press motion in active use | Set down on rack, hand pats it / wipes with a towel (post-set state) |
| Cars / vehicles | Wide shot of the car parked or driving by | Macro on a specific feature — badge, wheel, door handle being pulled |
| Outdoor gear / sunglasses | Worn on the face / body (medium close) | Removed and held up against the sky / outdoor light (different state) |
| Cleaning appliances (mop / steamer) | Wide shot of the appliance gliding across the floor / surface | Different surface (e.g., tiled bathroom vs hallway hardwood) OR macro on the cleaning head touching debris |
| Pet products | The pet using the product (eating from the bowl, walking on the leash) | Macro on a product detail (chew mark on the toy, tag on the collar) |
| Tools / hardware | Tool in active use on the material | Macro on the result — clean cut, driven screw, tightened bolt (post-action) |

If the product category is not in this table, derive the same principle: pick TWO actions / contexts / targets that are visibly different — never just two scales of the same shot.

---

## Step 5 — Camera POV and Hand Allocation Per Slot

Each slot picks the POV that fits the product-demo intent AND obeys the Hand Allocation Rule when an auxiliary person appears. **POV may change between slots — every POV change aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition.**

### Camera POVs

| POV | When to use |
|---|---|
| **TRIPOD** — locked-off, both creator hands free, camera does not move | Product introduction shot; product demo where product needs both hands of an auxiliary person; result hero shot |
| **FIRST-PERSON-POV** — camera IS the person filming; only the person's hand/forearm appears at frame edge holding or operating the product; phone object NEVER visible | Demo close-ups where the camera is "the user's view" — applying perfume on own wrist, holding the cordless vacuum POV-style, looking down at the product in own hand |
| **MACRO** — extreme close-up on product detail / mechanism / texture | Slot 3 default — product detail / texture / state-change moment |
| **WIDE-CONTEXT** — camera at distance, person + product visible in environment, product still the focal element | Wide demo (vacuum on far wall, far-away action with product as the readable focus) |

### Hand Allocation Rule (hard constraint, when auxiliary person appears)

The auxiliary person has exactly two hands. Count hands before finalizing every slot.

**FIRST-PERSON-POV:**
- ONE hand of the person is implicitly holding the phone (the camera). The phone object itself is NEVER visible — only the person's free hand or forearm at the edge of frame.
- Only the OTHER hand is available for action — holding ONE object (the product, or interacting with the product on a surface).
- If the slot requires two free hands on the product → **FIRST-PERSON-POV is FORBIDDEN. Switch to TRIPOD with auxiliary person cropped.**

**TRIPOD with auxiliary person cropped:**
- Both auxiliary person's hands are free for product manipulation.
- Phone is not in frame; no hand holds it.
- Suitable for any two-handed product action (lifting, twisting, holding product + cap simultaneously, gripping with both hands).

**TRIPOD with NO person:**
- Pure product shot. No hands in frame.
- Suitable for PRODUCT-INTRO, MACRO product detail, PRODUCT-RESULT hero shot.

**Hard validation rule (must appear in the rendering rules of every prompt):**
`Count hands per slot when an auxiliary person appears. The person has exactly two hands. In FIRST-PERSON-POV, one hand is implicitly occupied by the phone (off-frame), so only one hand is available for product action — never depict the auxiliary person holding two objects in FIRST-PERSON-POV. Two-handed product actions force TRIPOD POV with the auxiliary person cropped (phone not in frame). POV may change between slots; every POV change aligns with a hard cut. No third arm, no extra hand, no impossible grip. The person never speaks on camera — mouth closed in every slot.`

---

## Step 6 — Safe Interaction Verbs

| Material | Safe verbs | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| Glass / hard plastic / metal | rests on palm, holds lightly, cradles, presents, taps gently, points at, sets down, stands upright | squeeze, crush, clench, twist body, deform |
| Soft tube | holds, gently squeezes, presses lightly | crushes, wrings, twists violently |
| Fabric / clothing | wears, adjusts, smooths, drapes, holds up | stretches unnaturally, yanks, wrings |
| Cardboard box | holds from sides, presents front face, sets on surface | crushes, bends, folds unnaturally, tears |
| Food | bites, pours, scoops, stirs, serves | throws, juggles, morphs, multiplies |
| Tech / electronics | holds, presents, points to screen/detail, sets on desk | opens compartments, plugs cables |
| Appliance (vacuum, blender, etc.) | grips handle, glides, runs over surface, presses button, sets upright | flips, spins, drops, shakes violently |
| Any product | holds, shows, lifts, presents, points at, demonstrates on surface | throws, catches, juggles, spins, drops |

When unsure → hold-and-present only.

---

## Step 7 — Product Angle Lock and Realistic Scale

Angle Lock is mandatory.

### Angle Lock — one product image
`@Image1 is the product reference. ANGLE LOCK: the product shows only the visible front-facing side from @Image1. The product keeps this same visible angle in every slot it appears in. Do not rotate, spin, flip, or reveal unseen sides.`

### Angle Lock — multiple product images
`@Image1 and additional product references show valid angles. The product may appear only from these provided angles. Switch angles only by hard cuts between slots, never by continuous rotation. Do not invent intermediate or unseen sides.`

Angle rules:
- Camera movement ≠ product rotation.
- The product can move closer/farther but the visible side stays consistent.
- Never invent back labels, side panels, or internal components.
- Product label, color, shape, and logo identical across all appearances.

### Realistic Scale (mandatory)

The product MUST appear at its real-world physical size relative to any auxiliary hand, body, or surface. Image models default to enlarging the product so the label is readable — this is forbidden. **If the product is too small to read in frame, move the camera closer to the product. Do not scale the product up.**

Reference real-world sizes:

| Category | Real-world size |
|---|---|
| Perfume / EDP bottle (50-100 ml) | ~10-12 cm tall, fits comfortably in one palm |
| Cologne (large, 100-200 ml) | ~13-16 cm tall |
| Serum dropper bottle (30 ml) | ~8-10 cm tall, fits in fingers |
| Cream jar (30-50 ml) | ~6-8 cm wide, sits on palm |
| Soft tube (cream, lotion) | 12-18 cm long |
| Lipstick / twist-up balm | 7-9 cm tall |
| Mascara / lip gloss tube | 10-12 cm tall |
| Pump bottle (250 ml lotion / shampoo) | 18-22 cm tall, two-hand grip natural |
| Compact / powder | 7-10 cm wide, fits in palm |
| Spray bottle (mist, body spray) | 15-20 cm tall |
| Energy drink / soda can | ~12 cm tall standard, ~16 cm slim |
| Snack bag (single serve) | 15-20 cm tall, hand-sized |
| Tech (phone-sized device) | reference against another smartphone |
| Cordless vacuum / upright appliance | ~100-115 cm tall, person-scale |
| Blender / kitchen appliance | ~35-45 cm tall, fits on counter |
| Drill / power tool | ~25-30 cm long, two-hand grip |

Add explicitly to the prompt: `Product is rendered at realistic real-world scale relative to any auxiliary hand, body, or surface. The product is approximately [X cm] tall and fits naturally in context without enlargement. If the label is small in frame, the camera moves closer rather than scaling the product up.`

### Weight & Grip Logic (mandatory — when auxiliary person handles the product)

Before depicting the auxiliary person holding/lifting the product, classify by weight and size:

| Class | Examples | Hand allocation | Facial expression (when face partially visible) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy | Appliance, bottle >=1L, toolbox-class, drill, vacuum upright | BOTH hands required, body leans forward to lift | Visible strain — jaw set, slight brow furrow, controlled exhale |
| Bulky but light | Oversized box, large pillow, big plush, tall but empty container | BOTH hands required for stability | NO strain — relaxed, easy grip |
| Light | Cosmetics, phone, small bottle, jewelry case | ONE hand, relaxed grip | Neutral / pleased, no strain |
| Tiny | Single earring, pill, contact lens, small chip | Pinched between thumb and index finger, held close to lens | Focused / curious, no strain |

Single-handed lifting of heavy items is FORBIDDEN — produces unrealistic, AI-tell renders. Two-handed strain on light items is also FORBIDDEN — produces over-acted, fake renders. Always classify before writing the slot description; if the class is ambiguous, default to the heavier class (safer for realism).

**Paired or set products (dumbbells, kettlebells set, hand weights pair, gloves pair, earrings sold as pair):** never stack or balance both halves on a single palm or hand. Natural display options:
- **(a) One in each hand at chest level** — works for light or moderate weight (single-hand grip per item)
- **(b) One held up in display position, the other set down** on the surface beside character — works for heavy items
- **(c) Both visible side-by-side on a flat surface** with hand near or touching them but not balancing — works for any weight

**NEVER both halves balanced on one palm** — guaranteed AI-tell render. For FIRST-PERSON-POV slots, only ONE half of a pair can be in the free hand; the other is set down off-frame or beside.

## Step 8 — Product Placement & Visibility Logic

The product is visible in EVERY slot of a product-flow board. Defaults:

- Slot 1 (PRODUCT-INTRO): product fully visible, primary subject of frame.
- Slot 2 (PRODUCT-DEMO-A): product fully visible, in active use.
- Slot 3 (PRODUCT-DEMO-B): product fully visible, second demo angle.
- Slot 4 (PRODUCT-RESULT): product visible in result state OR final hero shot.

The product is NEVER hidden inside a closed bag/box/pocket in this flow — it is the hero. The "hidden product" patterns from talking-head / unboxing flows do not apply here.

### Forbidden placements (must appear in the rendering rules)

`Forbidden product placements: product half-sticking out of a container, product balancing on top of an open bag, product wedged between objects, product floating, product peeking from a pocket with cap exposed. The product is fully visible in every slot — either held cleanly, set on a surface, or in active demo use. Never partial, never sticking out, never awkwardly positioned.`

## Step 9 — Product Interaction Sequences

Every product interaction must use exact visible hand mechanics. Never write vague "uses it / demonstrates it / applies it."

| Product | Required physical sequence |
|---|---|
| Perfume / cologne | Hold base → lift cap straight up → cap disappears → press nozzle → mist on wrist or neck |
| Serum dropper | Hold bottle → unscrew dropper counterclockwise → lift pipette → squeeze bulb → drops on fingertips |
| Cream jar | Hold base → twist lid off counterclockwise → lid disappears → fingertip scoop |
| Soft tube | Hold middle → flip or unscrew cap → squeeze → product on fingertip |
| Pump bottle | Hold base → press pump head with two fingers → product on palm |
| Lipstick / twist-up balm | Hold base → pull cap straight off → cap disappears → twist base → swipe lips |
| Mascara / lip gloss wand | Hold tube → unscrew wand → pull out slowly → apply to eyelashes / lips |
| Compact / powder | Hold compact → flip hinged lid (lid stays attached) → tap brush/sponge → apply |
| Spray bottle / mist | Hold bottle → remove cap if visible → press trigger/nozzle → mist target |
| Food / drink | Show package → open if plausible → pour/scoop/bite/drink naturally |
| Clothing / shoes | Hold up → wear → adjust fit → smooth fabric → point to detail |
| Tech / electronics (generic — non-peripheral) | Hold-and-present, point to screen or exterior detail. No complex button/cable mechanics. **For peripherals (mouse, keyboard, headphones, earbuds, controller, phone, watch, tablet, laptop, stylus) — see "Natural grip patterns for tech peripherals" subsection below.** |
| Cordless vacuum / appliance | Grip handle → press power button / trigger → glide over surface (carpet / floor / ceiling) → release |
| Blender / kitchen appliance | Place on counter → press button → contents move inside → pour result |
| Drill / power tool | Grip handle → align bit on target → squeeze trigger → controlled action |

General rules:
- Maximum one product state change per slot.
- Removed caps/lids disappear after removal — never described again.
- Two hands max. Never two separate hand actions at the same time.
- Two-handed interactions force TRIPOD POV.

### Natural grip patterns for tech peripherals (mandatory)

For tech peripherals — gaming mouse, keyboard, headphones, earbuds, controller, phone, watch, tablet, laptop, stylus — the natural grip is **ergonomic**, not a fingertip "hold-and-present". When the product is one of the categories below, use the natural grip pattern from this table instead:

| Peripheral | Natural grip / position |
|---|---|
| Gaming mouse | Full palm cup over the mouse — fingers naturally curl over left-click and right-click, thumb rests on the side or thumb-button, base of palm touches the mousepad. NEVER pinched between fingertips, NEVER hovering above without contact. |
| Mechanical keyboard | Both hands in typing position with fingers approximately on the home row OR one hand resting with index finger on a specific key for a macro detail shot. NEVER hands hovering far above the keys. |
| Headphones (over-ear) | Held by the headband (top arc) when off-head, or worn on head with ear cups settled over ears. NEVER held by an ear cup as the only contact point, NEVER pinched. |
| Earbuds / TWS | Pinched between thumb and index by the stem (close to lens for macro), OR worn in ear with hand absent from frame. NEVER held by the bud body itself. |
| Game controller | Both hands wrap the standard grips — fingers around the back, thumbs on the analog sticks, index fingers on the shoulder triggers. NEVER one-handed, NEVER pinched at the corners. |
| Smartphone | Vertical hold by the side edges with one hand, OR cradled with one hand on the back while the other hand swipes / taps. NEVER pinched at a corner. |
| Smartwatch | Worn on the wrist (preferred), OR if off-wrist, pinched by the strap (NOT by the watch face). |
| Tablet | Cradled with one hand under the bottom edge; the other hand swipes / taps the screen. NEVER held mid-air at one corner. |
| Laptop | On a flat surface (desk / lap) with both hands on the keyboard typing, or one hand on the touchpad. NEVER held mid-air, NEVER carried open-screen. |
| Stylus / pen | Standard pencil grip — thumb, index, and middle finger; tip touches screen / paper. NEVER pinched at the eraser end. |

### Cross-board product state continuity (K > 1 only)

Within a single board (4 slots), product state may stay constant — e.g., all 4 slots show the product with cap on if the demo is "hold/present". Cap-state inside one board is NOT enforced.

But across boards: when a previous-board reference is provided (K > 1) and that previous board's final slot showed the product in an open / running state (cap off, applicator extended, lid flipped, vacuum running), board K's slots MUST continue that state — never re-close a previously-opened product across boards.

## Step 10 — Auxiliary Person Performance Direction

When an auxiliary person appears in a slot, their on-screen behavior is supportive, never expressive in a "talking" way:

- **Mouth closed.** No on-camera dialogue. No speaking gesture toward the lens. The audio is voice-over off-screen.
- **Functional micro-behaviors only** — ones that support the product action: hand gripping the product, fingers adjusting a setting, palm guiding product over surface, thumb pressing a button, hand setting the product down, cropped silhouette stepping past the product, hand pointing at a detail, fingers tracing a feature.
- **No "warm smile at camera" / "looking at camera with confidence"** — these belong to creator-as-hero flows, not product-as-hero.
- **Gender consistency** — the auxiliary person's gender matches `voice_gender` and stays consistent within one board. Different boards may show different incidental people but always within the gender lock.

Avoid as descriptors:
- "smiles at the camera"
- "looks at the camera and says..."
- "holds product and talks"
- "explains while holding"
- Identical pose across all slots

Expression progression across the 4 slots is product-state-driven, not emotion-driven:
- Slot 1 (PRODUCT-INTRO) — product establishing; person calm / absent
- Slot 2 (PRODUCT-DEMO-A) — product in use; hand focus, body calm
- Slot 3 (PRODUCT-DEMO-B) — product in different angle; hand re-positioned
- Slot 4 (PRODUCT-RESULT) — product result visible; person (if shown) in supportive cropped pose, no big reaction face

## Step 11 — UGC Visual Style Inside Each Slot (iPhone aesthetic — DEFINING feature)

The output MUST read as a real creator's phone photo — NOT a product-ad shoot, NOT a fashion editorial, NOT a studio session, NOT a DSLR-graded commercial still. This is the most important rule in this section. Skip it and the output flips to "polished product ad" — which loses all UGC credibility. Product-flow is especially vulnerable to this drift because TRIPOD-locked product shots and MACRO product details naturally resemble commercial product photography.

Base UGC visual style:
- Natural light (default: soft neutral daylight from a clear directional source — left or right window, OR even ambient room light)
- Slight phone-camera grain visible on surfaces and (when person is partial) skin
- Realistic skin texture when person partially visible — visible pores, natural unevenness
- Real home or everyday environment matching the product's use context
- Imperfect framing, mild handheld feel where appropriate
- Authentic creator energy — like a casual phone capture, not a planned shoot
- No studio lighting, no glossy retouching, no cinematic lens
- No mirror or reflection shots

### Mandatory iPhone phrasing — include in every slot description (or in the rendering rules block)

These phrases MUST appear (verbatim or close paraphrase):

- `Shot on iPhone, casual handheld framing`
- `Phone-sensor grain and realistic surface texture preserved — no retouch, no smooth-skin filter, no professional gloss`
- `Natural ambient light typical of a phone photo — even, slightly imperfect, not dramatically lit`
- `Authentic UGC creator phone photo of the product in real-life context — NOT editorial product photography, NOT studio shoot, NOT magazine commercial`

### HARD BAN — never appear in any prompt

These phrases produce editorial / studio / DSLR product-ad look — the OPPOSITE of UGC:

- `dramatic side-lighting`, `cinematic lighting`, `moody atmospheric lighting`, `mood lighting`
- `shallow depth of field`, `aggressive bokeh`, `creamy bokeh`, `professional DSLR lens`, `lens flare aesthetic`
- `editorial product photography`, `product shoot`, `commercial product still`, `studio strobes`, `softbox`, `ring light`
- `magazine retouch`, `glossy professional finish`, `polished commercial look`
- `mid-length portrait`, `editorial portrait`, `fashion portrait`, `aspirational lifestyle atmosphere`
- `flawless surface`, `flawless finish`, `glossy reflections highlighted`
- `centered composition at eye-level` — too studio-posed
- `glowing skin`, `flawless skin`, `radiant complexion` — too retouched (when person partial)
- `golden hour`, `warm sunset`, `late-afternoon warm wash`, `magic hour` — neutral daylight only

### Closing block — append verbatim at the end of every slot description (or once at end of rendering rules)

```
Shot on iPhone, casual phone framing, phone-sensor grain and realistic textures preserved, no retouch, no professional gloss. Authentic UGC creator phone photo of the product in real-life context — NOT editorial product photography, NOT studio shoot, NOT magazine commercial.
```

If a slot description omits this block, the output drifts toward product-ad polish — always include it.

## Step 12 — Sheet Layout

- Exactly 4 slots in a single horizontal row, left to right.
- All slots have identical dimensions: exact 9:16 vertical rectangles.
- Slots are separated by thin white gutters.
- Sheet background is clean white between slots.
- **Total sheet aspect: 21:9.**
- No header, no footer, no surrounding chrome.
- **All four slots are always active. There are no placeholder slots.**

- No on-image text, no captions, no badges, no numbers, no pop-text, no subtitles, no watermarks, no labels.
- The product label (if visible on the physical product) keeps its real text accurately — that is part of the product itself, not added typography.

---

## Step 13 — Rendering Rules

The final image prompt must demand:
- Exactly 4 slots, identical size, exact 9:16 each, single horizontal row, total sheet aspect 21:9.
- Thin white gutters between slots.
- All four slots active — no placeholders.
- Photorealistic UGC iPhone stills, no text overlays of any kind.
- **Product is the hero of every slot.** Person, when present, is auxiliary (cropped, hands-only, partial body, first-person POV) and never the focal subject.
- **Auxiliary person mouth is closed in every slot.** No on-camera dialogue. Voice-over is off-screen.
- **Auxiliary person gender matches `voice_gender`** and stays consistent within one board.
- Consistent product design across all slots (Angle Lock).
- **Product at realistic real-world scale**, not enlarged. Camera moves closer if the label needs to be readable.
- **Product placement is clean** — fully visible held, set on a surface, or in active demo use. Never half-sticking out, never balancing awkwardly, never partial.
- **Hand count enforced when auxiliary person appears** — two hands max. FIRST-PERSON-POV occupies one hand with the phone (off-frame), leaving one for action. Two-handed actions force TRIPOD POV.
- **POV may change between slots** — every POV change aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition.
- Same setting and lighting across slots within the same location; switch only when the demo crosses to a new use context.
- When a previous-board reference is provided (K > 1), product / location / lighting MUST match the reference unless the story explicitly demands a change.
- No mirror/reflection shots. No deformed hands. No third arm. No additional brands or IP. No watermarks. No subtitles. No captions. No headers. No metadata. No pop text. No badges. No numbers.

---

## Hard Restrictions

- A product is REQUIRED. This flow does not generate "no-product" lifestyle / talking-head shots.
- Never describe the auxiliary person's age, ethnicity, attractiveness, makeup, or facial features in detail. Brief functional descriptors only.
- Never generate more or fewer than 4 slots.
- Never make slots different sizes from each other.
- Never deviate from exact 9:16 per slot.
- Never include placeholder slots — all four are always active.
- Never put any text, header, metadata, caption, badge, number, pop-text, subtitle, or watermark on the sheet.
- Never invent unseen product sides when product reference is provided.
- Never enlarge the product beyond its real-world physical size — move the camera closer instead.
- Never depict more than two hands on any auxiliary person. FIRST-PERSON-POV = one phone-hand + one free hand only. Two-object holds in FIRST-PERSON-POV are forbidden — switch to TRIPOD with auxiliary person cropped.
- **Never make the auxiliary person the focal subject.** No full-body portraits, no centered head-and-shoulders selfies, no "creator-as-hero" framing. Person is always cropped / hands-only / partial / POV-only.
- **Never depict the auxiliary person speaking on camera.** Mouth is closed in every slot. No open mouth, no speaking gesture toward lens, no "explaining" expression. The audio is voice-over off-screen.
- **Never mix genders within one board.** When `voice_gender` is `female`, every auxiliary person rendering in this board is female. Same for `male`. `random` → pick one and lock it for the board.
- Never use mirror or reflection shots.
- Never use unsafe or physically impossible product interactions.
- Never invent legal claims, medical claims, certifications, or unsupported superiority claims about the product.
- Never include unrelated real-world brands or IP.
- Never ignore user-specified setting, action, or duration.
- **Slot 1 of Board 1 MUST always show the product in introduction state** (native context, not yet in active use). The active demo lands in Slots 2 and 3; the result lands in Slot 4. Never default Slot 1 to "product mid-action".
- **Slot 4 MUST be visually distinct from Slot 1** — never re-use Slot 1's composition, angle, scale, or surface placement.
- Never depict heavy products lifted single-handedly — heavy items require BOTH hands AND visible facial strain. Never depict two-handed strain on light items either.
- **Never balance heavy items (dumbbells, weights, tools, kettlebells) or paired products on a single palm** — heavy and paired items require natural gripping mechanics (one-per-hand, or one-displayed-other-set-down, or side-by-side on surface).
- Never break the previous-board match when K > 1 unless the story explicitly demands a context change.
